# The Eagle Hill Fund
This repository is dedicated to any and all code created by the Eagle Hill Fund.

## Repository Purpose

The repository is, broadly speaking, broken into two purposes.

1. The construction of various portions of The Eagle Hill Fund website using Django and React.
2. Various python utilities that are created by and for The Eagle Hill Fund.

## Future Plans

This repository could be split into multiple at some point but there is yet to be an impetus for this.
