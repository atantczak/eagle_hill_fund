However,\\ncurrent multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective\\nattention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet\\neffective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate\\n\"visual thoughts\" by performing visual editing on the input image through code,\\nshifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables\\nmultimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input\\nimage, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out\\nareas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a\\nwide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts.\\nReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual\\nediting, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart\\ntasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual\\nedits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing\\nadditional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus,\\nand prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information\\noffers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average\\ngain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.',\n  'pdf_link': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05452v1'},\n {'title': 'An Empirical Study of Autoregressive Pre-training from Videos',\n  'summary': 'We empirically study autoregressive pre-training from videos.

However, effectively leveraging these predictions for\\ngeometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains\\nrelatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view\\nimage alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth\\npriors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based\\nsolutions.
