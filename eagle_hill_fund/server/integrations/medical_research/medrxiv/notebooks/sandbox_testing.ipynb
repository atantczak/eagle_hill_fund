We hypothesized that communication types during social media use might alter the relationship between social media dependence and anxiety over time.

Lagged logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations evaluated the influence of daily SMA and communication type on subsequent anxiety levels.\\n\\nResultsOut of 79 participants, 1009 daily records were analyzed. SMA positively correlated with anxiety (Kendall rank correlation {tau}=.30). Interaction analysis indicated that levels of parasociality and consumption moderated the association between SMA components and anxiety outcomes. In young adults with high levels of consumption or parasociality, a 1-standard-deviation rise in SMAs social conflict component led to an 11%-13% increase in next-day anxiety scores.

In China, microbial contamination in drinking water is of particular concern and comprehensive survey/monitoring of the drinking water microbiome is necessary. However, traditional culture-based microbial monitoring methods have significant limitations, and nationwide tap water survey/monitoring in China would require significant resources. Here, a cost-effective and culture-independent citizen science approach was developed to sample the microbiome in household drinking water (n = 50) from 19 provinces in China from December 2020 to August 2021, including a few opportunistic samples collected in situ right after extreme weather events such as the 2021 Henan Floods and Typhoon In-Fa Landfall. Using a protocol optimized for low-biomass samples, 22 out of 50 tap water samples were tested positive for microbial DNA. 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding were conducted on pooled samples, yielding 7,635 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), which revealed a diverse microbiome in household tap water.

However, general purpose AI models require rigorous evaluation before being applied to real-world medical cases. Objective: This project specifically evaluates GPT-4V's performance in accurately diagnosing and generating treatment plans for common dermatological conditions, comparing its assessment of textual versus image data and its performance with multimodal inputs. Beyond the immediate scope, this study contributes to the broader trajectory of integrating AI in healthcare, highlighting the limitations of these technologies, as well as their potential to enhance efficiency, and education within medical training and practice. Methods: A dataset of 102 images representing nine common dermatological conditions was compiled from open-access websites. Fifty-four images were ultimately selected by two board- certified dermatologists as being representative and typical of the common conditions. Additionally, nine clinical scenarios corresponding to these conditions were developed. GPT- 4V's diagnostic capabilities were assessed in three setups: Image Prompt (image-based), Scenario Prompt (text-based), and Image and Scenario Prompt (combining both modalities). The model's performance was evaluated based on diagnostic accuracy, differential diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. Results: In the Image Prompt setup, GPT-4V correctly identified the primary diagnosis for 29 of 54 images. The Scenario Prompt setup showed a higher accuracy rate of 89% in identifying the primary diagnosis. The multimodal Image and Scenario Prompt setup also achieved an 89% accuracy rate. However, a notable bias towards textual data over visual data was observed. Treatment recommendations were evaluated by the same two dermatologists, using a modified Entrustment Scale, showing competent but not expert-level performance. Conclusion: GPT-4V demonstrates promising capabilities in dermatological diagnosis and treatment recommendations, particularly in text-based scenarios. However, its performance in image-based diagnosis and integration of multimodal data highlights areas for improvement. The study underscores the potential of AI in augmenting dermatological practice, emphasizing the need for further development, and fine-tuning of such models to ensure their efficacy and reliability in clinical settings.

Here we introduce Bridge Capture, a novel technology that goes beyond the advantages of market-leading liquid biopsy technologies, eliminating the need to compromise between scalability, cost-efficiency, sensitivity, or panel size. We compared Bridge Capture to leading commercial technologies currently available in cancer diagnostics; Archer LIQUIDPlex and AmpliSeq Cancer HotSpot Panel v2 for Illumina(R). Of all methods, Bridge Capture detected the lowest mutant allele frequency (MAF) on matched contrived colorectal biospecimens mimicking ctDNA. Next, we demonstrated the capability of Bridge Capture to effectively utilize the sequencing capacity, permitting affordable and sensitive variant detection in smaller laboratories, while delivering significant cost savings for central laboratories. Additionally, we demonstrated the reproducibility of Bridge Capture by a high correlation between the results from two independent laboratories. These results highlight the methods portability and suitability for kit use in entirely new settings. Moreover, we presented ease of automation and minimal hands-on time of Bridge Capture.

Using publicly available GWAS summary statistics from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we comprehensively depicted the genetic architecture of 2024 multi- organ AI endophenotypes (MAEs). Two AI- and imaging-derived subtypes1 showed lower polygenicity and weaker negative selection effects than schizophrenia disease diagnoses2, supporting the endophenotype hypothesis3. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses reveal both within-organ relationships and cross-organ interconnections. Bi-directional causal relationships were established between chronic human diseases and MAEs across multiple organ systems, including Alzheimers disease for the brain, diabetes for the metabolic system, asthma for the pulmonary system, and hypertension for the cardiovascular system. Finally, we derived polygenic risk scores for the 2024 MAEs for individuals not used to calculate MAEs and returned these to the UK Biobank.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes MHC-I degradation and is elevated in glioma. Evolocumab is a clinically approved PCSK9 inhibitor, which restores MHC-I expression in pre-clinical cancer models. However, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have limited blood brain/tumor barrier penetrance (BBB/BTB). The aim of this window-of-opportunity trial was to evaluate evolocumabs BBB/BTB penetrance and biological effect in glioma (PesKE; NCT04937413).\\n\\nMethodPatients with newly diagnosed/recurrent glioma undergoing a clinically indicated biopsy or resection were enrolled (n=32, M: 16, F: 16; control average age: 51.85, evolocumab: 53). Intervention participants (n=6) received subcutaneous evolocumab 4-14 days pre-procedure. 4/6 intervention participants provided research tissue.\\n\\nResultsNo significant adverse events were observed. Evolocumab was detected in all analyzed intervention tissue, with an average tumor:blood ratio of 0.0222 (SD{+/-}0.0190), akin to other mAbs. Evolocumab quantitation was 4.44x greater in contrast-enhancing (mean 0.0068 fmol/mcg (SD{+/-}0.001)) vs non-contrast enhancing cases (mean 0.0015 fmol/mcg (SD{+/-}0.0004)). Proteomic analysis found positive trends between evolocumab and MHC-I subtypes (HLA-A-C, E-G), with a significant positive correlation with HLA-H (R2=0.9584, p=0.021*). Tumor tissue with higher evolocumab titers demonstrated increased surface MHC-I and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Increased CD8+ TNF, FASLG and GZMA transcription was observed in high titer tissue compared to low titer tissue/untreated controls.\\n\\nConclusionsPre-resection evolocumab is well tolerated but exhibits BBB/BTB penetrance akin to other mAbs. Increased tumoral evolocumab/PCSK9i may enhance tumoral MHC-I/effector CD8+ infiltration. Future work will explore combining evolocumab with BBB/BTB opening therapies like low-intensity focused ultrasound.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LIPCSK9 promotes MHC-I degradation and is increased in glioma\\nC_LIO_LIEvolocumab (PCSK9 mAb inhibitor) exhibits BBB penetrance akin to other mAbs\\nC_LIO_LITumoral evolocumab titers correlates with tumor cell surface MHC-I expression\\nC_LI\\n\\nImportance of the studyThis tissue-based study evaluates the pre-clinical finding that PCSK9 inhibition (PCSK9i) increases cell surface MHC-I expression in the clinical glioma setting. Of note, PCSK9 is specifically elevated in glioma, a tumor which is known for low MHC-I expression and typically possesses few tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. PCSK9i was achieved by means of a peripherally administered monoclonal antibody (mAb, evolocumab). Though uptake of evolocumab across the blood-brain/tumor barrier (BBB/BTB) was similar to other mAbs, dose-response relationships between intratumoral evolocumab and MHC-I subtypes were observed. Having observed that PCSK9i can induce biological changes within tumor, we will rationalize our approach to explore combination with BBB/BTB opening therapies such as low-intensity focused ultrasound. Window-of-opportunity studies like PesKE demonstrate how tissue-based trials permit rapid evaluation of a drugs pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties in glioma. Here, we find evidence of PD (biological) effect and will now explore combination approaches to enhance PK parameters (tumoral uptake).\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/24309192v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ecae9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc296org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141c71org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@575b7a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.06.26.24309490',\n  'title': 'Type I interferon responses contribute to immune protection against mycobacterial infection',\n  'authors': 'Szydlo-Shein, A.; Sanz-Magallon Duque de Estrada, B.; Rosenheim, J.; Turner, C.

Type I interferon activity in tissue samples from the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge, the tuberculin skin test, was associated with less severe human TB disease. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased burden and dissemination of Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish larvae. The mechanism for increased severity of mycobacterial infection in zebrafish involves reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict bacterial growth.

The Vietnamese livestock plan issued in 2017 has, among other objectives, strengthened the regulatory framework for antibiotic use. While a progressive ban on prophylactic antibiotics in feed and the introduction of mandatory prescriptions have been introduced, the level of implementation of these measures remains unknown. This study explores the level of understanding, acceptance, and application of these regulations among veterinary drug value chain stakeholders. An iterative stakeholder mapping and analysis of the veterinary drug value chain was conducted in north and south Vietnam. We organized one focus group discussion in Hanoi with 12 participants and conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with governmental authorities, national research centers, foreign partners, and private stakeholders along the value chain. The discourses were analyzed to (1) map the veterinary drug value chain and interactions among stakeholders, (2) analyze stakeholders technical and social capital regarding regulations, and (3) identify factors influencing their implementation. From the map of the veterinary drug value chain, we identified 30 categories of stakeholders. Based on the map, the capital, and the analysis of the discourse, we identified 10 factors that could influence their implementation. These factors included stakeholder perception of the new regulations, their level of knowledge, the availability of technical guidance, conflict of economic interest between stakeholders, scale-related management discrepancies, the technical and financial barriers to the implementation of the regulations at the local level, the presence of an informal distribution channel, international influence, consumer demand for food safety, and the willingness to reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance. It was clearly identified that new regulations are a necessary step to reducing antibiotic usage in Vietnam, but that the lack of local stakeholder involvement combined with technical constraints were barriers to their implementation. The study underlined the need for greater involvement of local stakeholders in the development of regulations as well as the need to mainstream innovations developed by small producers.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.07.17.24310568',\n  'title': 'Channel Capacity of Genome-Wide Cell-Free DNA Fragment Length Distribution in Colorectal Cancer',\n  'authors': 'Matov, A.',\n  'author_corresponding': 'Alexandre Matov',\n  'author_corresponding_institution': 'DataSet Analysis LLC',\n  'date': '2025-01-08',\n  'version': '7',\n  'type': 'PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT',\n  'license': 'cc_by_nc_nd',\n  'category': 'oncology',\n  'jatsxml': 'https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2025/01/08/2024.07.17.24310568.source.xml',\n  'abstract': 'Each piece of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has a length determined by the exact metabolic conditions in the cell it belonged to at the time of cell death.

Despite its clinical benefits, propofol is associated with increased risks of hypertriglyceridemia. Early identification of patients at risk for propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia is crucial for optimizing sedation strategies and preventing adverse outcomes. Machine learning (ML) models offer a promising approach for predicting individualized patient risks of propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia.\\n\\nMethods and analysisWe propose the development of a ML model aimed at predicting the risk of propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia in ICU patients receiving IMV. The study will utilize retrospective data from four Mayo Clinic sites. Nested cross-validation (CV) will be employed, with a 10-fold inner CV loop for model tuning and selection as well as an outer loop using leave-one-site-out CV for external validation. Feature selection will be conducted using Boruta and LASSO-penalized logistic regression. Data preprocessing steps include missing data imputation, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction techniques. Six ML algorithms will be tuned and evaluated. Bayesian optimization will be used for hyperparameter selection. Global model explainability will be assessed using permutation importance, and local model explainability will be assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).\\n\\nEthics and disseminationThe proposed ML model aims to provide a reliable and interpretable tool for clinicians to predict the risk of propofol-associated hypertriglyceridemia in ICU patients.

E. granulosus life cycle involves definitive, intermediate, and humans as dead-end hosts. Echinococcosis control programs use strategies that focus on any of these hosts. We aimed to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the EG control interventions worldwide.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a scoping review by mapping all studies on interventions for EG control following the Arksey and OMalley Framework. We screened identified articles, and charted and coded selected papers. We classified the data based on target host, type of study, and control mechanism. We described the efficacy or safety outcomes, and the associated barriers/facilitators for the intervention. Critical appraisal was conducted.\\n\\nResultsFrom 7,853 screened studies, we analyzed 45: seven centered on human interventions, 21 on animals, and 17 on both. Studies on humans focused on educational strategies and human CE monitoring. The studies on animals were field trials and most were based on Praziquantel (PZQ) for dogs. Studies focused on both animals and humans had, in general, more participants, lasted longer, and covered larger geographical areas. Overall, the quality of studies was moderate to low.\\n\\nConclusionsAvailable evidence suggests that long-term interventions aimed at both animals and humans can achieve significant reduction in EG transmission, particularly when PZQ treatment for dogs is included. Higher quality evidence, standardization of methodologies, and better reporting on post-intervention outcomes are necessary for drawing stronger conclusions. Further evidence is needed to assess the sustainability and scalability of control measures. Nonetheless, an integrative One Health approach is essential for overcoming the multiple challenges associated with sustaining long-term control efforts for Echinococcosis.\\n\\nFundingRCN was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant nos.

This parasite can be found in specific areas on all continents, especially in poverty-stricken regions, increasing costs and losses. Some countries have achieved control, but most are still in the process. Our review provides a clear picture of what we currently know about these control strategies and points out where more research is needed. It highlights how the findings can improve control practices by showing what works best and address practical challenges. The review also identifies gaps in current knowledge and suggests that comparing different control methods could help find the most effective and cost-efficient solutions.\\n\\nKey areas needing attention include increasing support and funding for echinococcosis, as the disease is often overlooked. More research from different fields is needed to better understand and manage the diseases complexities. Better and ongoing surveillance is crucial for maintaining effective control strategies. Finally, comprehensive reviews that bring together findings from different studies are needed to identify what works best and improve and combine future control efforts.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.08.28.24312701',\n  'title': 'Post-processing and weighted combination of infectious disease nowcasts',\n  'authors': 'Amaral, A.

A variety of probabilistic nowcasting methods have been suggested to correct for the resulting biases. Building upon a recent comparison of eight of these methods in an application to COVID-19 hospitalization data from Germany, the objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate how nowcasts from different models can be improved using statistical post-processing methods as employed, e.g., in weather forecasting. Secondly, we assess the potential of weighted ensemble nowcasts, i.e., weighted combinations of different probabilistic nowcasts. These are a natural extension of unweighted nowcast ensembles, which have previously been found to outperform most individual models. Both in post-processing and ensemble building, specific challenges arise from the fact that data are constantly revised, hindering the use of standard approaches. We find that post-processing can improve the individual performance of almost all considered models both in terms of evaluation scores and forecast interval coverage. Improving upon the performance of unweighted ensemble nowcasts via weighting schemes, on the other hand, poses a substantial challenge. Across an array of approaches, we find modest improvement in scores for some and decreased performance for most, with overall more favorable results for simple methods. In terms of forecast interval coverage, however, our methods lead to rather consistent improvements over the unweighted ensembles.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.08.28.24312707',\n  'title': 'Low-cost generation of clinical-grade layperson-friendly pharmacogenetic passports using oligonucleotide arrays',\n  'authors': 'Lanting, P.; Warmerdam, R.; Slager, J.; Brugge, H.; Ochi, T.; Benjamins, M.; Lopera, E.

Almost all individuals will carry a genetic marker that affects their drug response, so the ideal drug prescription for these individuals will differ from the population-level guidelines. Currently, PGx information is often not available at first prescription, reducing its effectiveness. Pharmacogenetic information is most often obtained using special assays, making it expensive and time-consuming to generate. We therefore hypothesized that we could also use genome-wide oligonucleotide genotyping arrays to generate comprehensive PGx information (PGx passports), thereby decreasing the cost and time required for PGx testing, and lowering the barrier to generating PGx information prior to first prescription.\\n\\nTaking advantage of existing genetic data generated in two biobanks, we developed and validated Asterix, a low-cost clinical-grade PGx passport pipeline for 12 PGx genes.

In addition, we developed and validated a novel CYP2D6 copy number variant calling tool, foregoing the need to use separate PCR-based copy number detection. Ultimately, we returned 1227 PGx passports to biobank participants via a layperson-friendly app, improving knowledge of PGx among citizens.

In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where most cervical cancer cases occur, access to precancer treatment is severely limited. Scalable solutions like self-administered topical therapies can help close this gap. In a recent Phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05362955), we demonstrated safety and adherence to self-administered intravaginal 5% 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) cream as an adjuvant therapy for cervical precancer among women living with HIV (WLWH) in rural Kenya. To understand womens experiences with self-administered 5FU, we evaluated the acceptability of this intervention among trial participants.\\n\\nMETHODSAll 12 participants from the Phase I trial completed a structured questionnaire and in-depth semi-structured interviews in their preferred language, focusing on their experiences with 5FU self-administration, challenges faced, and overall acceptability of the intervention, including whether they would use it again or recommend it to someone who needed it. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In the qualitative study, acceptability was defined as \"the perception that a given treatment is agreeable, palatable, or satisfactory.\" A thematic analysis was conducted using five dimensions of acceptability: content, complexity, comfort, delivery, and credibility.\\n\\nRESULTSThe mean age was 43.9 years (SD 4.4), and 7 (58%) had primary education or less. While some participants reported feelings of uncertainty when they started using 5FU, at the end of the study, all twelve participants strongly agreed that the cream was safe and were confident they used it correctly. Most participants (91.7%) experienced no discomfort with the vaginal applicator, and most reported using tampons overnight after 5FU use, as recommended. Qualitative findings revealed that favorable perceptions of self-administered 5FU were driven by its ease of use, the discrete nature of the treatment, and the comfort of home application. The main challenges included correctly measuring the study drug, finding a private place at home to self-administer, and the need to use condoms during treatment. Compared to their previous ablation or excision treatments, participants found 5FU to be less painful, and all would prefer a self-administered treatment instead of a procedure if it were an option.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSelf-administered intravaginal 5FU as an adjuvant treatment for cervical precancer among women living with HIV in Kenya was highly acceptable.

Women with symptomatic POP stages I-III were randomized by cluster to receive either midwife-led PFMT plus lifestyle counseling (intervention group) or lifestyle counseling alone (control group). The participants and counsellors knew what the women were receiving but they were not aware of the other group. The outcome assessors, who collected data at the end of intervention, were blinded to the participants treatment allocation. The primary outcomes were changes in prolapse symptom score (POP-SS) and prolapse quality of life (P-QoL). Mixed-effects generalized linear model was used to determine the effect of PFMT on prolapse symptoms and P-QoL at 99% confidence level. Adjusted {beta} coefficients were used as effect measures. The level of significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons.\\n\\nA total of 187 women were randomized to intervention (n=86) from 4 clusters and control (n=101) arms from another four clusters. At sixth months, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvements both in prolapse symptoms and P-QoL. The mean change difference in POP-SS was -4.11 (99% CI [-5.38, -2.83]; p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean change difference was: -8.86 (99% CI [-13.84, -3.89]; p<0.001) in physical domain of P-QoL; -11.18 (99% CI [-15.03, -7.32]; p<0.001) in psychological domain of P-QoL, and -9.01 (99% CI [-, -5.54]; p <0.001) in personal relationship domain of P-QoL. A significantly higher proportion (83.72%) of women in the intervention group perceived their condition as \"better\" after the intervention as compared to 41.58% in the control group. Women with earlier stages of prolapse (stage I and II) experienced higher benefits compared to those in stage III.\\n\\nConclusionsA midwife-led PFMT combined with lifestyle counseling significantly improves prolapse symptoms and quality of life in mild to moderate POP.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), predominantly in use as a type 2 diabetes treatment, are a promising pharmacological approach for weight loss, while bariatric surgery (BS) remains a durable, but invasive, intervention. Despite observed heterogeneity in weight loss effects, the genetic effects on weight loss from GLP1-RA and BS have not been extensively explored in large sample sizes, and most studies have focused on differences in race and ethnicity, rather than genetic ancestry. We studied whether genetic factors, previously shown to affect body weight, impact weight loss due to GLP1-RA therapy or BS in 10,960 individuals from 9 multi-ancestry biobank studies in 6 countries. The average weight change between 6 and 12 months from therapy initiation was -3.93% for GLP1-RA users, with marginal differences across genetic ancestries. For BS patients the weight change between 6 and 48 months from the operation was -21.17%. There were no significant associations between weight loss due to GLP1-RA and polygenic scores for BMI or type 2 diabetes or specific missense variants in the GLP1R, PCSK1 and APOE genes, after multiple-testing correction.

Second, we removed  race correction from estimated glomerular filtration rate and kidney failure under more equal conditions of US veterans. Third, we used data re-analysis and close examination of social cofactors to suggest alternative mechanisms for links between socially constructed  race, apolipoprotein L1 gene variants, and racialized kidney disease.\\n\\nRESULTSOur research found no  racial disparity in kidney failure under more equal social conditions and that geographically localized \"ancestry markers\" may proxy for  race.

In this study, we addressed two current clinical knowledge gaps; (i) are there qualitative or clear distinctions between behavioural profiles in bvFTD and SD, and (ii) what are the precise roles of the prefrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobes in supporting social behaviour? Resolving these conundrums is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and for the development of targeted interventions to treat challenging behaviours in FTD. Informant questionnaires to assess behavioural changes included the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised and two targeted measures of apathy and impulsivity. Participants completed a detailed neuropsychological battery to permit investigation of the relationship between cognitive status (including social-semantic knowledge, general semantic knowledge and executive function) with behaviour change in FTD. To explore changes in regional grey matter volume, a subset of patients had structural MRI. Diagnosis-based group comparisons were supplemented by a transdiagnostic approach which encompassed the spectrum of bvFTD, SD and \"mixed\" or intermediate cases. Such an approach is sensitive to the systematic graded variation in FTD and allows the neurobiological underpinnings of behaviour change to be explored across an FTD spectrum. We found a wide range of behavioural changes across FTD. Although quantitatively more severe on average in bvFTD, as expected, the item-level analyses found no evidence for qualitative differences in behavioural profiles or \"behavioural double dissociations\" between bvFTD and SD. Comparisons of self and informant ratings revealed strong discrepancies in the perspective of the caregiver versus patient. Logistic regression revealed that neuropsychological measures had better discriminative accuracy for bvFTD versus SD than caregiver-reported behavioural measures. A principal component analysis of all informant questionnaire domains extracted three components, interpreted as reflecting: (1) apathy, (2) challenging behaviours and (3) activities of daily living. More severe apathy in both FTD subtypes was associated with (a) increased levels of impaired executive function and (b) anterior cingulate cortex atrophy. Questionnaire ratings of impaired behaviour did not correlate with either anterior temporal lobe atrophy or degraded social-semantic knowledge. Together, these findings highlight the presence of a wide range of behavioural changes in both bvFTD and SD, which vary by degree rather than quality.

Monitoring SDs could be used to institute and guide SD-based therapeutics if noninvasive detection methods were available. Our primary objective is to use a high density array of electrodes to compare scalp direct current (DC)-shifts to SDs detected by gold standard electrocorticography (ECoG) to establish proof-of-concept validation that scalp DC-potentials can potentially provide noninvasive SD detection. Our secondary objective is to assess usability and artifact tolerance.\\n\\nMethodsAn 83x58 mm thermoplastic elastomer array with 29 embedded 6-mm diameter Ag/AgCl 1-mcm spaced electrodes, the CerebroPatch Proof-of-Concept Prototype, was adhesively placed on the forehead with an intervening electrode gel interface to record DC-electroencephalography in normal volunteers and severe acute brain injury patients in the neuro-intensive care unit some with and some without invasive subdural ECoG electrodes. The scalp and ECoG voltages were collected by a Moberg(R) Advanced ICU Amplifier. Artifacts were visually identified and usability issues were recorded. SD was scored on ECoG using standard criteria of DC shift with associated suppression of high frequency activity with propagation across the electrode. A six parameter Gaussian plus quadratic baseline model was used to produce time-course ECoG and scalp electrode channel plots and heat-map movies of scalp voltages. The similarity of the noninvasive scalp and invasive ECoG DC-shift time-courses was compared via the Gaussian fit parameters and confirmed if the Coefficient-of-Determination exceeded 0.80.\\n\\nResultsUsability and artifact issues obscured most scalp Prototype device data except for 38 of the 140 ECoG-coded SDs over a period of 11 days in one sub-arachnoid hemorrhage patient. 26 of these DC-shifts were in readable, artifact free portions of scalp recordings and 24 had an acceptable, >0.80 Coefficient-of-Determination (0.98 [0.02], median [IQR]) between invasive ECoG and noninvasive Prototype device DC-shifts.

In Stage 1 of the project, a list of potential trustworthiness checks was created. The checks on this list must be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.\\n\\nMethodsWe attempted to apply 72 trustworthiness checks to RCTs in 50 Cochrane Reviews. For each, we recorded whether the check was passed, failed or possibly failed, or whether it was not feasible to complete the check. Following application of the checks, we recorded whether we had concerns about the authenticity of each RCT. We repeated each meta-analysis after removing RCTs flagged by each check, and again after removing RCTs where we had concerns about authenticity, to estimate the impact of trustworthiness assessment. Trustworthiness assessments were compared to Risk of Bias and GRADE assessments in the reviews.\\n\\nResults95 RCTs were assessed. Following application of the checks, assessors had some or serious concerns about the authenticity of 25% and 6% of the RCTs, respectively. Removing RCTs with either some or serious concerns resulted in 22% of meta-analyses having no remaining RCTs. However, many checks proved difficult to understand or implement, which may have led to unwarranted scepticism in some instances. Furthermore, we restricted assessment to meta-analyses with no more than 5 RCTs, which will distort the impact on results. No relationship was identified between trustworthiness assessment and Risk of Bias or GRADE.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study supports the case for routine trustworthiness assessment in systematic reviews, as problematic studies do not appear to be flagged by Risk of Bias assessment. The study produced evidence on the feasibility and impact of trustworthiness checks. These results will be used, in conjunction with those from a subsequent Delphi process, to determine which checks should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.\\n\\nPlain language summarySystematic reviews collate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to find out whether health interventions are safe and effective. However, it is now recognised that the findings of some RCTs are not genuine, and some of these studies appear to have been fabricated. Various checks for these \"problematic\" RCTs have been proposed, but it is necessary to evaluate these checks to find out which are useful and which are feasible. We applied a comprehensive list of \"trustworthiness checks\" to 95 RCTs in 50 systematic reviews to learn more about them, and to see how often performing the checks would lead us to classify RCTs as being potentially inauthentic. We found that applying the checks led to concerns about the authenticity of around 1 in 3 RCTs. However, we found that many of the checks were difficult to perform and could have been misinterpreted. This might have led us to be overly sceptical in some cases. The findings from this study will be used, alongside other evidence, to decide which of these checks should be performed routinely to try to identify problematic RCTs, to stop them from being mistaken for genuine studies and potentially being used to inform healthcare decisions.\\n\\nWhat is newO_LIAn extensive list of potential checks for assessing study trustworthiness was assessed via an application to 95 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in 50 Cochrane Reviews.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing application of the checks, assessors had concerns about the authenticity of 32% of the RCTs.\\nC_LIO_LIIf these RCTs were excluded, 22% of meta-analyses would have no remaining RCTs.\\nC_LIO_LIHowever, the study showed that some checks were frequently infeasible, and others could be easily misunderstood or misinterpreted.\\nC_LIO_LIThe study restricted assessment to meta-analyses including five or fewer RCTs, which might distort the impact of applying the checks.\\nC_LI',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.11.28.24317877',\n  'title': 'Epigenetic Age Monitoring in Professional Soccer Players for Tracking Recovery and the Effects of Strenuous Exercise',\n  'authors': 'Brooke, R.

Early detection of brain amyloidosis (A{beta}+) is pivotal for diagnosing Alzheimer disease (AD) and optimizing patient management, especially in light of emerging treatments. While plasma biomarkers are promising, their combined diagnostic value through specific ratios remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of plasma pTau isoform (pTau181 and pTau217) to A{beta}42 ratios in detecting A{beta}+ status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS. This study included 423 participants from the multicenter prospective ALZAN cohort, recruited for cognitive complaints. A{beta}+ status was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Validation of the key findings was performed in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, where A{beta}+ status was determined using PET imaging. EXPOSURES. Plasma biomarkers (pTau181, pTau217, A{beta}40, A{beta}42) were measured using immunoassays and mass spectrometry, with specific ratios calculated. In the ALZAN cohort, the impact of confounding factors such as age, renal function, ApoE4 status, body mass index, and the delay between blood collection and processing was also evaluated to assess their influence on biomarker concentrations and diagnostic performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers and their ratios for detecting A{beta}+ status. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients classified as low, intermediate, or high risk for A{beta}+ using a two-cutoff approach. RESULTS. The pTau181/A{beta}42 ratio matched the diagnostic performance of pTau217 with AUC of 0.911 (0.880-0.936). The pTau217/A{beta}42 ratio demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy in the ALZAN cohort, with an AUC of 0.927 (0.898-0.950), outperforming individual biomarkers. Both ratios effectively mitigated confounding factors, such as variations in renal function, and were particularly excellent in identifying A{beta}+ status in individuals with early cognitive decline. Validation in the ADNI cohort confirmed these findings, with consistent performance across different measurement methods. The two-cutoff workflow using pTau217/A{beta}42 reduced the intermediate-risk zone from 16% to 8%, enhancing stratification for clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE. The pTau217/A{beta}42 ratio offers superior diagnostic accuracy for detecting A{beta}+ compared to individual biomarkers and reduces diagnostic uncertainty.

However, challenges persist in workflow integration, compliance, and widespread adoption. This study leveraged a Learning Health System (LHS) framework to align research and operations using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation protocol, embedded as pragmatic trial operations within the electronic health record (EHR).\\n\\nMethodsAn alpha phase was conducted to pilot technical integration, refine workflows, and determine sample size in planning for a beta phase designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) as primary outcome. During alpha, bi-directional governance was established between IS operations and LHS team with multidisciplinary workgroups for analytics, technical, documentation, and user experience. Ambient AI was embedded into the EHR using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), with real-time data dashboards tracking utilization and documentation accuracy for operations and research. Performance metrics were monitored serially using a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to detect drift caused by software workflow changes.\\n\\nResultsThe alpha phase, designed as Type 1 Hybrid, informed a 24-week beta phase stepped-wedge trial with 90% power to detect changes in PFI. Across the alpha phase, the weighted median of average provider Ambient AI utilization was 65.4% following Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles addressing organizational feasibility and task-dependent adoption. Diagnosis code accuracy dropped from 79% to 35% (p < 0.01) during alpha but recovered with a new note template and provider training. DiD did not detect significant drifts in work outside of work or time in notes two weeks before and after the new note template.

In this 4-year naturalistic follow-up of the initial ePOD-methylphenidate RCT, we investigated the long-term age-dependent effects of stimulant treatment on development of the dopamine system in children and adults with ADHD (n=56; adolescents aged 10-17 years, adults aged 23-43 years).

Linear mixed models were constructed to evaluate the effect of stimulant medication use, age and visit on resting rCBF and rCBF-response. We found no evidence for long-term age-dependent effects of stimulant treatment on development of the dopamine system, suggesting that our previously identified short-term effects may be transient.

A total of 150 isolates were identified both biochemically and using VITEK-2. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was achieved using the disc diffusion method.

However, compared to E. coli, the MDR prevalence of K. pneumoniae in different zones was significant (p-value=0.0081). Of the total isolates, 79.3% were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producers. The resistance to ESBL in E. coli was higher than in K. pneumoniae.

It consists of the cerebrospinal fluid, the interstitial fluid, and a conduit between the two, perivascular spaces (PVS), which are channels formed by astroglial cells surrounding the blood vessels. PVS can be observed on high-resolution T1-weighted MRI images. Small studies have implicated PVS and glymphatics in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, potentially via reduced clearance of excitotoxic substances. This study investigates enlarged PVS burden in a large patient group with various types of epilepsy.\\n\\nMethodsPeople with various types of epilepsy were recruited from the Hospital das Clinicas, Unicamp, Brazil. They were matched approximately in age and sex with healthy volunteers as controls. All participants were scanned with T1-weighted MRI on a 3T Phillips MRI scanner, resolution 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm3. A deep-learning algorithm, PINGU, was applied to segment PVS. The volumes of PVS in the White Matter (WM) and Basal Ganglia (BG) were calculated and divided by the respective volumes of WM and BG to derive the volume fractions (PVS-VF). These were used as dependent variables in a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as the independent variable of interest and age and sex included as nuisance covariates.\\n\\nResultsWe recruited 467 people with epilepsy (median age 42 years, 41.5% male), of whom 267 had temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS), 71 TLE with no MRI-visible lesions (TLE-NEG), 65 with focal extratemporal epilepsy (ETLE), and 64 with Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE)). They were matched with 473 healthy controls (median age 35 years, 38.3% male). All epilepsy subtypes had higher PVS-VF in the BG compared to controls (101-140%, effect size=0.95-1.37, p<1.33x10-15). There was no difference in PVS-VF in the WM between the epilepsy group and healthy controls, or between different epilepsy subtypes. The TLE-HS group had an asymmetry in their PVS distribution, being larger on the contra-lateral side. This was not observed in the healthy controls or any other epilepsy subtypes. There was no association between PVS-VF and duration of illness (median duration 29 years).\\n\\nConclusionVolume of PVS in the BG is enlarged in people with epilepsy.

Medicare, a vital federal healthcare program, is particularly susceptible to such abuses. With over 63 million Americans enrolled in Medicare and growing expenses, the need for effective fraud detection is paramount. Traditional methods relying on manual audits have proven insufficient, allowing a significant portion of fraudulent activity to go undetected. Machine learning (ML), however, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for improving the efficiency of fraud detection and prevention. Nonetheless, there are several issues with the existing studies utilizing ML that limit their effectiveness. The most common issue is the heavy reliance on the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) from the Office of the Inspector General for model training and evaluation. Apart from the severe class imbalance issue (with a fraud rate between 0.038% and 0.074%), another notable problem associated with using the LEIE dataset is that many of the providers listed there were prosecuted due to overt and deliberate fraudulent billing. Consequently, using this dataset to train ML models can help detect brazen, outlandish billing patterns, but would be unable to pinpoint instances of more subtle fraud from which a majority of the financial loss and waste occurs. In this paper, we leverage the experience of seasoned physicians and medical billers to create a labeled dataset that overcomes the issues of class imbalance and the exclusive focus on overtly fraudulent providers. We leverage our access to domain knowledge by focusing on the field of ophthalmology. Additionally, using the labeled dataset, we conduct a comparative study of various machine learning models for the task of predicting Medicare overutilization within ophthalmology. The results indicate that our proposed ensemble outperforms individual models such as extreme gradient boosting and multilayer perceptron in detecting overutilization, achieving Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC score) of 0.907. By deploying the stacking ensemble model, our paper estimates nationwide and jurisdiction-specific overutilization rates, revealing that approximately 8.6% of ophthalmologists engaged in overutilization practices in 2021. We also highlight potential monetary losses of $437.1 million attributed to overutilization activities within ophthalmology for that year alone. Furthermore, feature importance analysis using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provides insights into the key factors influencing the models overutilization predictions.

For lumefantrine, susceptibility was decreased with wild-type PfCRT K76T or PfMDR1 N86Y, mutant PfK13 C469Y or A675V, the newly identified PfCARL D611N mutation, which increased in prevalence over time, and a number of other polymorphisms. For DHA, RSA results were not associated with PfK13 mutations, but susceptibilities based on IC50s were decreased in parasites with the PfK13 C469Y or A675V mutations and the newly identified PfMDR1 Y500N mutation.\\n\\nInterpretationSusceptibilities to antimalarial drugs were mostly excellent, but decreased activities of lumefantrine and DHA over time suggest potential loss of efficacies of leading regimens.\\n\\nFundingNational Institutes of Health, Medicines for Malaria Venture, Gates Foundation.\\n\\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for combinations of the terms \"antimalarial resistance\", \"malaria\", \"Plasmodium\", \"Africa\", \"ex vivo\", \"pfmdr1\", \"pfcrt\", \"kelch\", or \"K13\" and identified papers published between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 30, 2024 on antimalarial drug sensitivity and resistance in Africa. A prior identical search was conducted for papers published from Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2020 in preparation for an earlier publication. We reviewed and included any relevant articles cited in those references. Our search identified many studies on antimalarial drugs and molecular markers of resistance, but few combining ex vivo drug susceptibility with genotyping results.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyThis study provides a comprehensive assessment of ex vivo susceptibility of Ugandan Plasmodium falciparum parasites to nine antimalarial drugs from July, 2019 to June, 2024. It also characterized genotype-phenotype associations based on these ex vivo data and sequencing of 80 genes identified as potential resistance mediators. Our findings add value to the existing literature by providing comprehensive data on antimalarial drug susceptibility in Uganda, including ex vivo drug susceptibilities for >1100 isolates from two regions of the country, description of changes in drug susceptibilities over time, and characterisation of genotype-phenotype associations, considering genetic polymorphisms previously associated with resistance to various antimalarials and potential novel resistance mediators.\\n\\nImplication of all the available evidenceMalaria parasites circulating in eastern and northern Uganda over the past five years were mostly sensitive to commonly used antimalarial drugs. However, parasite genotypes and phenotypes have changed over time. Most importantly, susceptibilities to dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine, the components of the first-line antimalarial therapy in Uganda, have decreased over time, although the magnitudes of these decreases are modest, and the clinical implications of the results are uncertain. Continued performance of parasitological and genomic surveillance for evidence of antimalarial drug resistance and institution of policy changes to limit resistance selection and treatment failure should be high priorities.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.12.31.24319808',\n  'title': 'Incidence and Clinical Presentation of Noma in Northern Nigeria (1999-2024)',\n  'authors': 'Braimah, R.

It often affects children between two and six years in Sub-Saharan Africa (Noma Belt region), with most cases reported in northern Nigeria. However, little research is available on the incidence of noma and its clinical presentation in this region using comprehensive data. Therefore, this study aims to determine the incidence of noma and its clinical presentation in northern Nigeria among different age groups. We collected retrospective data of 1,383 consecutive patients managed at Noma Childrens Hospital, Nigeria between 1999 and 2024 for incidence estimation and description of the clinical presentation of noma. Incidence calculation was done using the WHO Oral Health Unit strategy designed with the Delphi method. Our results showed that patients were between 8 months and 80 years old with a median age (IQR) of 6 years (3-15). More patients presented with acute noma than arrested noma (67.3% vs 32.7%). The estimated incidence of noma in northern Nigeria during the study period was 114.5 cases per 100,000, with Sokoto state having the highest incidence of 921.9 cases per 100,000, while Adamawa state had the lowest incidence of 6.3 cases per 100,000. The annual average and median incidence of noma across all years was 4.4 and 2.2 cases per 100,000 (range: 0.2-21.3 cases per 100,000), although between 2020 and 2024, the annual average and median incidence estimates were 15.5 and 15.6 cases per 100,000. Also, this study found the incidence of noma cases with gangrene to be higher than cases with oedema or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. These findings confirm the high incidence and impact of noma in northern Nigeria in the last two and half decades and highlight the need to intensify awareness of risk factors and early signs of noma within communities in the region and to conduct community-based screening to promote the identification and cost-effective treatment of reversible early noma disease.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNoma is a severe and deadly gangrenous disease that affects the mouth and other tissues of the face. It is often associated with poverty and is currently prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. More cases have been described in northern Nigeria than in any African region. However, the incidence of noma and its clinical presentation in this region is unknown from data available from different states. In this study, we retrospectively collected data from the only dedicated specialist hospital for noma intervention in Nigeria between 1999 and 2024 to calculate noma incidence within this period. Then the incidence of noma was calculated using a method proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This study estimates an incidence of 114.5 cases per 100,000 within the study period and an annual average and median incidence of 4.4 and 2.2 cases per 100,000. Of note, the incidence of noma with gangrene (stage 3) was higher than the incidence of oedema (stage 2) or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (stage 1). These results highlight the importance and impact of noma in northern Nigeria and underscore the need for noma awareness and screening programs for population education and detection of early noma disease which are reversible with cost-effective interventions.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.12.31.24319817',\n  'title': 'Exploring Drug Repurposing for Rare Diseases: Leveraging Biomedical Knowledge Graphs and Access to Scientific Literature',\n  'authors': 'Yuryev, A.; Shkrob, M.; Tropsha, A.; Mitchell, G.',\n  'author_corresponding': 'Anton Yuryev',\n  'author_corresponding_institution': 'Elsevier',\n  'date': '2025-01-01',\n  'version': '1',\n  'type': 'PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT',\n  'license': 'cc_by',\n  'category': 'pharmacology and therapeutics',\n  'jatsxml': 'https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2025/01/01/2024.12.31.24319817.source.xml',\n  'abstract': 'Drug repurposing presents a potential solution for finding new therapies for rare and orphan diseases.

MORs are widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral organs, and the immune system. They mediate pain and reward and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of opioid, cocaine, and other substance use disorders. Using the long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PennPET Explorer instrument and the MOR selective radioligand [11C]carfentanil ([11C]CFN), we measured the whole-body distribution of MORs in 13 healthy humans. We also examined sex differences in MOR distribution at baseline and after pretreatment with the MOR antagonist naloxone.\\n\\nMethodsSix female and seven male healthy subjects underwent two [11C]CFN PET imaging sessions--one at baseline and one immediately following pre-treatment with the MOR antagonist naloxone (13 mcg/kg). Whole-body PET imaging was performed on the PennPET Explorer, a 142-cm axial bore instrument. [11C]CFN brain distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were determined using the occipital cortex and the visual cortex within it as reference regions. For peripheral organ DVRs, the descending aorta and proximal extremity muscle (biceps/triceps) were used as reference regions.\\n\\nResultsNaloxone blockade reduced MOR availability by 40-50% in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, and ventral tegmentum, brain regions known to express high levels of MORs. Women showed greater receptor occupancy in the thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and frontal and temporal lobes and a greater naloxone-induced reduction in thalamic MOR availability than men (ps <0.05). For determining brain MOR availability, there was less variance in the visual cortex than the occipital cortex reference region. For peripheral MOR determination, the descending aorta reference region showed less variance than the extremity muscle, but both showed blocking effects of naloxone.\\n\\nConclusions[11C]CFN whole- body PET scans are useful for understanding MOR physiology under both baseline and blocking conditions. Extra-CNS reference regions may be useful for quantifying radiotracers when a region devoid of binding in the CNS is unavailable. The LAFOV PET instrument was useful for measuring changes in the short-lived radiotracer [11C]CFN, with and without naloxone blocking.

Using a machine learning (ML) model--rather than the FVC LLN--to exclude restriction may improve the accuracy and equity of PFT interpretation. We sought to develop and externally validate a ML model to predict restriction from spirometry and to assess the potential impact of this model on PFT interpretation.\\n\\nMethodsWe included PFTs with both static and dynamic lung volume measurements for patients between 18 and 80 years of age tested at pulmonary diagnostic labs within two health systems. We used PFTs from one health system to train logistic regression, random forest, and boosted tree models to predict restriction using demographic, anthropometric, and spirometric data. We used PFTs from the second health system to externally validate these models. The primary measure of model performance was the NPV.

RNA-seq data from sporadic AD and control cases from the Knight ADRC, MSBB, and ROSMAP cohorts were processed and analyzed under the same analytical pipeline. An integrative clustering approach employing machine learning and multi-omics data was employed to identify molecularly defined profiles with different cognitive scores.\\n\\nResultsWe found several epilepsy-associated genes/pathways significantly dysregulated in a group of AD patients with more severe cognitive impairment. We observed 15 genes consistently downregulated across the three cohorts, including sodium and potassium channels, suggesting that these genes play fundamental roles in cognitive function or AD progression. Notably, we found 25 of these genes dysregulated in earlier stages of AD and become worse with AD progression.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings showed that epilepsy-causing genes showed changes in the early and late stages of AD progression, suggesting that they might be playing a role in AD progression.

Anatomical, diffusion-weighted, and sodium imaging was performed using a 7 Tesla MRI scanner.

Anatomical parcellation and multimodal coregistration allowed the use of parcels as nodes of whole-brain structural connectomes, linking structural connectivity measures to epileptogenicity and sodium parameters. Sodium parameters in patients were z-scored concerning homologous parcels in controls to allow comparison across regions of interest.\\n\\nHub regions had higher total sodium concentration (TSC) than non-hub regions in both patients and controls, and this difference was not observed for sodium signal fraction (f, a proxy of intracellular sodium homeostasis). Compared to controls, patients showed increased TSC in both epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic zones, and this increase in TSC was consistent in both hub and non-hub regions.

A ResNet-200d algorithm was trained on the mBRSET dataset and validated on mydriatic and non-mydriatic images. Performance metrics, such as accuracy, F1 score, and AUC, were evaluated.\\n\\nResultsThe mydriatic group had a higher proportion of gradable images (82.1% vs. 55.6%, P< 0.001). Factors such as systemic hypertension, older age, male gender, and longer diabetes duration were associated with lower image gradability in non-mydriatic images. Mydriatic images achieved better AI performance, with accuracy (82.91% vs. 79.23%), F1 score (0.83 vs. 0.79), and AUC (0.94 vs. 0.93).

We first conducted sex-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for suboptimal-sleep phenotypes (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), short and long sleep durations, and excessive daytime sleepiness) utilizing the Million Veteran Program (MVP) dataset.

This preference arises out of its relative intuition and its capability to strike a fine balance between complex disease pathways, statistical precision, and parsimony although being criticized by a wide variety of stakeholders. Transition probability matrices (TPMs) are the \"heart and soul\" of such models responsible for estimating patient dispositions. However, estimating such TPMs comes with its own set of challenges. In some situations, the transition data may be censored such that the health state of a patient is unknown for multiple time steps before the next observation or data immaturity especially in rare diseases. Craig and Sendi proposed the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm using uniform weights as a solution for unequal estimation intervals for partially observed data. However, this typically comes at the cost of increased within-state output variations with no optimization technique available in the literature.\\n\\nThe objective of this paper is to explore an optimized weighted version of the original EM algorithm, that aims to estimate the set of weights which minimizes the uncertainty of the estimated TPM against a target objective function. The weighting reduces the uncertainty of the estimate by considering the difference in temporal sparsity of the data when there are missing time steps.

There are however indications that for tropical P. vivax isolates, notably from Southeast Asia, the lower dose of 3{middle dot}5 mg/kg is insufficient. Determining the most effective regimen to eliminate P. vivax hypnozoites is needed to achieve elimination of this malaria parasite.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted an open-label randomised controlled trial in Kampong Speu province, Western Cambodia. P. vivax infected patients with uncomplicated malaria, diagnosed at the community level or in health centres of the province, were offered to participate. Patients aged less than 15 years old, and pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded. Enrolled patients were treated with a blood schizonticidal artesunate regimen of 2 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Upon enrolment, patients glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was determined. G6PD normal patients were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive either (i) 3{middle dot}5 mg/kg (low dose as 0{middle dot}25 mg/kg/day) or (ii) 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg (high dose as 0{middle dot}5 mg/kg/day) of primaquine over 14 days or (iii) no primaquine as comparator arm. G6PD deficient patients were assigned to the no-primaquine comparator arm. Randomisation was done by blocks of 5 using sealed envelopes. Upon enrolment, patients were relocated to the study site in Aoral town where no malaria transmission occurs to ensure that they were not reinfected during their 90-day follow-up. After 90 days of relocation, G6PD normal patients in the no-primaquine arm were provided 3{middle dot}5 mg/kg for 14 days of primaquine to be taken unsupervised. At day 90, all the patients returned home and they were further followed monthly for three months until day 180. The primary outcome was the treatment failure rate defined as the proportion of patients with at least one P. vivax recurrence within 90 days of relocated follow-up. All patients that completed treatment and complied with relocation without interruption before any recurrence was detected were included in the primary efficacy analysis. All patients enrolled and assigned to an intervention arm were included in the safety analysis. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04706130).\\n\\nFindingsBetween Nov 10, 2021, and Feb 10, 2024, a total of 160 patients were enrolled and 156 were allocated to one of the three study arms. Of these, 37 G6PD deficient patients were assigned to the no primaquine arm and 119 G6PD normal patients were randomised: 24 in the no primaquine arm, 49 in the primaquine 3{middle dot}5 mg/kg arm, and 46 in the primaquine 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg arm. The proportion of participants with at least one P. vivax recurrence within 90 days in the no primaquine arm was 81{middle dot}4% (95% CI 69{middle dot}6-89{middle dot}2). The proportion of participants with recurrence was higher in the low dose primaquine arm (24{middle dot}4%, 95% CI 14{middle dot}2-38{middle dot}7) compared to the high primaquine arm (4{middle dot}7%, 95% CI 0{middle dot}8-15{middle dot}5, p=0{middle dot}0141) resulting in a hazard ratio of high dose primaquine compared to low dose of 0{middle dot}17 (95% CI 0{middle dot}04-0{middle dot}79, p=0{middle dot}0229). Both primaquine arms were well tolerated.\\n\\nInterpretationNot providing primaquine to patients led to a considerable rate of P. vivax recurrence. The risk of P. vivax recurrence was 5{middle dot}9 times lower for the 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg of primaquine treatment compared to 3{middle dot}5 mg/kg. Tolerability and safety of both primaquine regimens in G6PD normal individuals was comparable. Policy makers in Cambodia and most likely in other Southeast Asian countries should endorse the 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg of primaquine regimen to reduce the risk of P. vivax relapses.\\n\\nFundingNational Institutes of Health (R01AI146590)\\n\\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe WHO treatment guidelines for preventing Plasmodium vivax relapses using primaquine recommend a range of 3{middle dot}5-7{middle dot}0 mg/kg. These guidelines mention that for P. vivax infections acquired in Southeast Asia and Oceania, 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg should be preferred. We searched Pubmed for randomized controlled trials studies containing the terms \"vivax\" and \"primaquine\" published between 1990 and November 2024, with no language restrictions, to identify studies comparing primaquine regimen to treat P. vivax infections. Our search retrieved only two studies comparing head-to-head the efficacy of 3{middle dot}5mg/kg with 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg primaquine administered over a same duration of 14 days but were both conducted in South Asia and both showed similar efficacy of high dose compared to low dose primaquine. No studies compared 3{middle dot}5 and 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg of primaquine administered over 14 days in South East Asian countries.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyThis randomised controlled trial compared the efficacy of a total dose of 3{middle dot}5 mg/kg and 7{middle dot}0 mg/kg of primaquine over 14 days to prevent relapses of P. vivax in Cambodia.

Targeting joint inflammation with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has not resulted in the anticipated reduction in pain for many patients. This can partly be explained by the concept of central sensitisation whereby spinal and supraspinal pathways have a lower threshold of activation leading to increased perception of pain. Synovial stromal cells such as fibroblasts are also thought to play a role through peripheral sensitisation of nerves in the joint. Synovial fibroblasts are known to produce pro-algesic mediators such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nerve growth factor (NGF) at the mRNA level. These pro-algesic mediators could activate sensory nerve fibres that send signals from the joint to the spinal cord, thereby driving persistent pain in RA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate which pro-algesic mediators are produced by lining versus sublining fibroblasts and whether the level of these mediators correlates with clinical measures of pain in patients with RA.\\n\\nMethods and analysisFiND-Pain RA is a multi-centre observational study which will recruit 50 patients with seropositive RA who attend the rheumatology department of Guys and St Thomas Hospital, London and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Clinical examination, pain-focused patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), ultrasound examination and ultrasound guided synovial biopsy of the knee will be performed. The levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators will be measured in fibroblasts from the lining and sublining layer of the synovium. The location and spatial morphology of sensory nerve fibres and their proximity to lining and sub-lining fibroblasts will be characterized. The primary outcome will be to determine whether the knee pain scores of participants correlate with the level of LIF, a novel putative pain-mediator expressed in sub-lining fibroblasts. The secondary outcomes will be to determine whether other pro-algesic mediators produced by lining or sub-lining fibroblasts correlate with clinical measures of pain and to assess the location and proximity of sensory nerve fibres to lining versus sub-lining fibroblasts.\\n\\nEthics and disseminationThe study has been approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee (REC: 21/LO/0712).

This objectively measured bias is reliable yet underutilized in informing clinical endpoints, as clinical trials largely employ subjective (i.e., self-report or interview-based drug use and craving) or simple categorical (e.g., drug in urine) measures, with limited success. Having previously demonstrated their utility in cocaine addiction, we investigated whether behavioral picture choice (a lab-simulated drug seeking measure) and verbal fluency similarly reveal drug bias in 59 abstinent, inpatient individuals with opioid use disorder (iOUD) compared to 29 healthy controls (HC). Using a hierarchical regression, and compared to subjective measures, we then tested whether these objective markers can better inform prospective treatment completion--a clinically relevant and measurable outcome. As expected, results showed that the iOUD exhibited higher simulated drug seeking (ps<0.036) and drug fluency (p=0.008) compared to the HC. Importantly, after dimensionality reduction, while the self-reported years of regular opioid use and cue-induced craving showed null results (|{beta}|<0.47, p>0.290), and controlling for demographics, drug choice was associated with treatment completion {beta} =-0.75, p=0.036), explaining greater variability in its likelihood compared to the subjective measures (model comparison:{Delta} R2=0.102, p=0.027).

It is widely accepted as the gold standard against which self-assessment tools, such as PCL, are usually evaluated. However, the clinician administered interviews are time and resource intensive, thus utilizing self-report measures is adopted as quicker and more practical to assess symptom severity. Although there have been demonstrations of the validity of PCL for PTSD diagnosis and assessment of symptom severity, PCL (including PCL-5 which is based on DSM-5 criteria) scores tend to overreport symptom severity sometimes leading to higher prevalence of PTSD diagnosis. The contributing factors for such discrepancies in reporting are poorly understood. Here we examined whether there are sex differences in the alignment of PCL-5 with CAPS-5. Our findings indicate that males often report higher PTSD symptom severity on PCL-5 which significantly deviates from a predicted correlation line based on their CAPS-5 scores. Female participants had no deviation from the predicted correlation line. Accordingly, 26.8% of males and only 11.4% of females had inaccurate PTSD status if they were evaluated on PCL-5 alone.

However, the pathways through which SDOH factors are associated with healthy aging remain unclear.\\n\\nMethodsThis retrospective cohort study used the registered tier data from the All of Us Research Program (AoURP) registered tier dataset v7. Eligible study participants are those aged 50 and older who have responded to any of the SDOH survey questions with available EHR data. Three different algorithms were trained (logistic regression [LR], multi-layer perceptron [MLP], and extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). The outcome is healthy aging, which is measured by a composite score of the status for 1) comorbidities, 2) cognitive conditions, and 3) mobility function. We evaluate the model performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and assess the fairness of best-performed model through predictive parity. Feature importance is analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values.\\n\\nResultsOur study included 99,935 participants aged 50 and above, and the mean (SD) age was 74 (9.3), with 55,294 (55.3%) females, 67,457 (67.5%) Whites, 11,109 (11.1%) Hispanic ethnicity, and 44,109 (44.1%) are classified as healthy aging. Most of the individuals lived in their own house (64%), were married (51%), obtained college or advanced degrees (74%), and had Medicare (56.2%). The best predictive model was XGBoost with random oversampler, with a performance of AUROC [95% CI]: 0.793 [0.788-0.796], F1 score: 0.697 [0.692-0.701], recall: 0.739 [0.732-0.748], precision: 0.659 [0.655-0.663], and accuracy: 0.716 [0.712-0.720], and the XGBoost model achieved predictive parity by similar positive and negative predictive values across race and sex groups (0.86-1.06). In feature importance analysis, health insurance type is ranked as the most predictive feature, followed by employment status, substance use, and health insurance coverage (yes/no).\\n\\nConclusionIn this cohort study, XGBoost model accurately predicted individuals achieving healthy aging, outperforming LR and MLP.

We recently released an open-source deep learning model to assess biological age from chest radiograph images (CXR-Age), which predicts incident all-cause and cardiovascular mortality better than chronological age. Here, we compare CXR-Age to two established epigenetic aging clocks (First generation - Horvath Age; Second generation - DNAm PhenoAge), to test which is more strongly associated with measures of cardiopulmonary disease. Our cohort consisted of 2,097 participants from the Project Baseline Health Study (PBHS), a prospective cohort study of individuals from four US sites enriched for cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease risk factors. We found that CXR-Age was most strongly associated with the presence of coronary calcium, cardiovascular risk factors, worsening pulmonary function, increased frailty, and abundance in plasma of two proteins implicated in neuroinflammation and aging. Associations with second generation epigenetic clocks were weaker for pulmonary function and for all outcomes in younger adults. No associations were found with first generation clocks. These results suggest that opportunistic screening using CXR-Age may help identify high risk individuals who could benefit from directed screening and prevention.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'},\n {'doi': '10.1101/2024.12.30.24319499',\n  'title': 'Systematic Prioritisation of AI-Detected Chest X-ray Abnormalities for Optimised Lung Cancer Detection',\n  'authors': 'Bramley, R.; Sharman, A.; Duerden, R.; Lyon, S.; Ryan, M.; Weber, E.; Brown, L.; Evison, M.',\n  'author_corresponding': 'Rhidian Bramley',\n  'author_corresponding_institution': 'Greater Manchester Cancer Alliance, c/o The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK',\n  'date': '2025-01-02',\n  'version': '1',\n  'type': 'PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT',\n  'license': 'cc_by_nd',\n  'category': 'radiology and imaging',\n  'jatsxml': 'https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2025/01/02/2024.12.30.24319499.source.xml',\n  'abstract': 'ObjectiveThis study aimed to establish a reproducible method for selecting AI-detected chest X-ray (CXR) abnormalities prioritised for urgent reporting to support faster lung cancer diagnosis.

Amputation results in a loss of sensory feedback and alterations in gait biomechanics, including co-contractions of antagonist muscles about the knee and ankle, and reduced pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop. SCS can restore sensation in the missing limb, but its effects on muscle activation and gait biomechanics have not been studied in people with lower-limb amputation.\\n\\nMethodsThis case study included a participant with transtibial amputation who was implanted percutaneously with SCS electrodes over the lumbosacral enlargement for 84 days. SCS was used during in-lab experiments to provide somatosensory feedback from the missing limb, relaying a sense of plantar pressure when the prosthesis was in the stance phase of the gait cycle. We used electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity from the residual and intact limbs, and 3D motion capture to measure pelvic obliquity. EMG signals were recorded during walking with and without SCS at early and late time points across the implant duration.\\n\\nResultsDuring walking, co-contraction of knee antagonist muscles was reduced following multiple sessions of SCS-mediated sensory restoration. Additionally, the activation of the hip abductor (tensor fasciae latae) muscle increased activity during gait with SCS-mediated sensory restoration, which corresponded to an increase in pelvic obliquity range-of-motion and pelvic drop, towards normal.\\n\\nConclusionsRestoring sensation in the missing limb using SCS modulated muscle activity during walking leading to improved coordination and pelvic motion in an individual with lower-limb amputation.',\n  'published': 'NA',\n  'server': 'medrxiv'}]"

      "text/plain": "\"The study examines the effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) on muscle activation and joint motion during walking in individuals with a transtibial amputation. Conducted by researchers from institutions like the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, and published on medRxiv, the study explores how SCS, which provides sensory feedback, can influence walking patterns in amputees. It highlights issues such as muscle co-contractions and reduced pelvic motion due to amputation and introduces SCS as a method to restore sensation in the missing limb. The case study involved a participant with a transtibial amputation who received SCS for 84 days. Using electromyography and 3D motion capture, the study assessed muscle activity and pelvic motion during walking with and without SCS. Results showed that SCS reduced knee muscle co-contractions and increased hip abductor activity, improving pelvic motion. The study concludes that SCS can enhance muscle coordination and pelvic motion in lower-limb amputees, potentially reducing fall risk by restoring somatosensory feedback. It also notes the prevalence of lower-limb amputation and the importance of restoring sensory feedback to improve stability and reduce falls. The study found that SCS engages spinal reflex pathways without altering step cycle duration or limb alternation symmetry. Over time, SCS use reduced knee antagonist muscle co-contractions and increased activity in the tensor fasciae latae muscle, enhancing pelvic motion. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh and conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA. The participant, a woman aged 60-65 with a left lower leg amputation due to diabetic neuropathy, used a non-motorized prosthesis before receiving an SCS lead implant. The study involved inserting three 8-contact SCS leads into the dorsal epidural space near the T12-L2 vertebral levels. Electrical stimulation was delivered through the leads, and their placement was adjusted based on the participant's feedback about sensation locations. The study involved real-time SCS during walking, with stimulation modulated by sensorized insoles and EMG recorded from leg muscles. The study observed a reduction in co-contractions of knee antagonist muscles over time, with further slight reduction when SCS was applied. Pelvic obliquity was assessed, showing changes in range-of-motion and pelvic drop at early and late time points, with and without SCS. Overall, SCS contributed to slight improvements in muscle activity and reduced co-contractions\""
