## Implementation Examples

```python
# Earnings Announcement Strategy
class EarningsAnnouncementStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, pre_announcement_days=5, post_announcement_days=10):
        self.pre_announcement_days = pre_announcement_days
        self.post_announcement_days = post_announcement_days
    
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implementation here
        pass

# FOMC Meeting Strategy
class FOMCMeetingStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, pre_meeting_days=3, post_meeting_days=5):
        self.pre_meeting_days = pre_meeting_days
        self.post_meeting_days = post_meeting_days
    
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
