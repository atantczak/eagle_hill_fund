# Trend-Following Strategies

This directory contains trend-following trading strategies that aim to capture and profit from sustained price movements in financial markets.

## Strategy Philosophy

Trend-following strategies are based on the assumption that asset prices tend to move in trends and that these trends can persist for extended periods. These strategies attempt to identify the beginning of a trend and ride it until it shows signs of reversal.

## Strategy Types

### 1. **Moving Average Strategies**
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossovers**: Uses two or more SMAs of different periods
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossovers**: Gives more weight to recent prices
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Combines trend and momentum signals

### 2. **Breakout Strategies**
- **Price Breakouts**: Identifies when prices break through key support/resistance levels
- **Volatility Breakouts**: Uses volatility expansion to signal trend changes
- **Donchian Channels**: Breakouts from highest high/lowest low over a specified period

### 3. **Momentum Strategies**
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
- **Rate of Change (ROC)**: Measures the speed of price changes
- **Momentum Oscillators**: Various momentum-based indicators

## Key Characteristics

- **Trend Identification**: Focus on identifying the direction and strength of trends
- **Entry Signals**: Clear entry points based on trend confirmation
- **Exit Strategies**: Systematic exit rules to capture profits and limit losses
- **Risk Management**: Stop-losses and position sizing based on volatility

## Implementation Examples

```python
# Moving Average Crossover
class MovingAverageCrossover(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, fast_period=20, slow_period=50):
        self.fast_period = fast_period
        self.slow_period = slow_period
    
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implementation here
        pass

# Breakout Strategy
class PriceBreakout(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, lookback_period=20, breakout_threshold=0.02):
        self.lookback_period = lookback_period
        self.breakout_threshold = breakout_threshold
    
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Market Regimes**: Performance varies across different market conditions
- **Transaction Costs**: Frequent trading can erode returns
- **Drawdowns**: Can experience significant drawdowns during trend reversals
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Performance sensitive to parameter selection

## Risk Management

- **Stop Losses**: Essential for limiting losses during false breakouts
- **Position Sizing**: Based on volatility and account size
- **Diversification**: Across multiple timeframes and assets
- **Market Filters**: Avoid trading in choppy or sideways markets

## Backtesting Requirements

- **Historical Data**: Sufficient data to test across different market cycles
- **Transaction Costs**: Include realistic trading costs
- **Slippage**: Account for execution delays and market impact
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Validate on unseen data
