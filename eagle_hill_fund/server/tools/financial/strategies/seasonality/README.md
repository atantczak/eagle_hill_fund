# Seasonality & Cyclical Strategies

This directory contains seasonal and cyclical trading strategies that exploit recurring patterns in financial markets based on time-based factors.

## Strategy Philosophy

Seasonality strategies are based on the observation that financial markets exhibit recurring patterns based on calendar effects, business cycles, and other time-based factors. These strategies identify and exploit these predictable patterns.

## Strategy Types

### 1. **Calendar Effects**
- **Day-of-Week Effects**: Exploits patterns in returns by day of the week
- **Month-End Effects**: Trades around month-end rebalancing
- **Turn-of-Month Effects**: Capitalizes on month-end and month-beginning patterns
- **Holiday Effects**: Trades around market holidays and closures

### 2. **Quarterly Patterns**
- **Earnings Season Drift**: Exploits post-earnings announcement drift
- **Quarter-End Rebalancing**: Trades around institutional rebalancing
- **Fiscal Year-End Effects**: Capitalizes on year-end tax and reporting effects
- **Dividend Seasonality**: Trades around dividend payment dates

### 3. **Annual Cycles**
- **January Effect**: Small-cap outperformance in January
- **Sell in May Effect**: Seasonal underperformance in summer months
- **Year-End Effects**: Tax-loss selling and window dressing
- **Summer Doldrums**: Lower volatility and trading activity

### 4. **Business Cycle Patterns**
- **Economic Calendar Effects**: Trades around key economic releases
- **Central Bank Meetings**: Trades around FOMC and other central bank meetings
- **Earnings Calendar**: Trades around earnings announcement dates
- **Options Expiration**: Trades around options expiration dates

## Key Characteristics

- **Time-Based Signals**: Signals based on calendar dates and time periods
- **Recurring Patterns**: Exploits patterns that repeat over time
- **Statistical Significance**: Patterns must be statistically significant
- **Persistence**: Patterns must persist over multiple cycles

## Implementation Examples

```python
# Day-of-Week Effect Strategy
class DayOfWeekEffect(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, target_days=['Monday', 'Friday']):
        self.target_days = target_days
    
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implementation here
        pass

# Earnings Season Drift Strategy
class EarningsSeasonDrift(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, lookback_days=5, forward_days=10):
        self.lookback_days = lookback_days
        self.forward_days = forward_days
    
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Pattern Persistence**: Seasonal patterns can change over time
- **Market Evolution**: Markets may adapt to known seasonal patterns
- **Transaction Costs**: Frequent trading can erode returns
- **Regime Changes**: Patterns may break down in different market conditions

## Risk Management

- **Pattern Validation**: Continuously validate pattern persistence
- **Position Sizing**: Adjust positions based on pattern strength
- **Stop Losses**: Essential for when patterns fail
- **Diversification**: Across multiple seasonal patterns

## Data Requirements

- **Historical Data**: Sufficient data to identify seasonal patterns
- **Calendar Data**: Accurate calendar and holiday information
- **Economic Calendar**: Key economic release dates
- **Earnings Calendar**: Company earnings announcement dates

## Statistical Analysis

- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Separate trend, seasonal, and random components
- **Autocorrelation**: Check for serial correlation in seasonal patterns
- **Significance Testing**: Statistical tests for pattern significance
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Validate patterns on unseen data

## Common Patterns

- **Monday Effect**: Historically negative returns on Mondays
- **Friday Effect**: Historically positive returns on Fridays
- **January Effect**: Small-cap outperformance in January
- **Halloween Effect**: "Sell in May and go away" pattern
- **Turn-of-Month Effect**: Positive returns around month-end

## Backtesting Considerations

- **Look-Ahead Bias**: Avoid using future information
- **Survivorship Bias**: Include delisted companies
- **Transaction Costs**: Include realistic trading costs
- **Slippage**: Account for execution delays
- **Regime Changes**: Test across different market regimes

## Implementation Challenges

- **Pattern Decay**: Seasonal patterns may weaken over time
- **Market Efficiency**: Markets may become more efficient
- **Data Quality**: Ensure accurate calendar and event data
- **Execution Timing**: Precise timing is critical for seasonal strategies
